    <h2 class="about-title">About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-text">
      <p class="intro">Hello,</p>
      <p class="intro">My name is Michael Vickers, and I wanted to start by saying thank you for taking the time to check out my portfolio! It means a lot!</p>
      <p class="intro">Here’s a little bit about me…</p>

      <p>I’m currently 24 years old and based in San Francisco, California. I obtained my undergraduate degree from Cal Poly Pomona (CPP) in May 2023, where I studied Computer Information Systems with an emphasis in Business Intelligence. I was drawn to that discipline because I wanted to graduate as a versatile, ready, professional! My curriculum consisted of several business-centric concepts (i.e., Finance, Real Estate, Accounting, and Marketing) and technical courses where I learned valuable languages such as SQL and Python.</p>

      <p>While attending CPP, I spent all 4 years working on the Annual Fund team. I started as a Student Fundraiser, where I cold-called alumni to build affinity with the university and raise donations. By the end of my tenure, I was the Engagement Center Coordinator, where it was my duty to build the Student Fundraiser team and manage our call center. Seeing firsthand how donations support students made me very passionate about philanthropy! It’s not only about being successful in your own right, it’s about paying it forward! Everyone should have an opportunity to pursue/chase their dreams regardless of their financial situation. I’m very proud to come from an institution that values this, and I will continue to support my alma mater!</p>

      <p>Since graduating, I’ve spent the 2 years working at a couple of large insurance brokerages (AJG/Acrisure) as a Client Service Associate II/Associate Account Manager. Serving as an intermediary between large construction businesses and insurance carriers has taught me a lot! Specifically, the importance of managing and maintaining relationships. This is accomplished by transparent communication, setting realistic expectations, providing high-quality service, and delivering results. Clients don’t want a salesman, they want a partner willing to go to war for their business!</p>

      <p>Enough of the professional talk, let me tell you more about myself! Outside of work, I live a fairly active lifestyle. A combination of running, strength training, sports, and hiking has me working out 5-6 times a week. I’m at my best when I’m staying physically active and feeling healthy! When I’m not doing something outside, you can find me locked into coding bootcamps, studying statistics, watching sports, playing Mario Kart, taking photos, reading <em>Invincible</em>, or spending time with my cat, Momo.</p>

      <p>Finally, what are my goals, and where do I see myself in five years?... The golden questions. To be completely honest, I don’t know. I’m passionate about several things and knowledgeable in a lot of areas. I’m incredibly versatile and a quick learner, but I’m still figuring out this weird, crazy, unpredictable thing called life. I’m taking everything one step at a time, but I want to surround myself with supportive, creative, equally motivated individuals who will push me to be the best version of myself! One thing I don’t want to stop doing is learning.</p>

      <p>If you’re interested in connecting or chatting, please reach out! I’m open to mentorship, advice, interesting conversation, new connections, and more friends!</p>

      <a href="https://mjvickers.github.io/" target="_blank">You’re looking at it!</a>
    </p>
    <p class="project-description">My most ambitious project yet, I designed and coded my portfolio from scratch using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Before this project, I had zero knowledge or experience in CSS or HTML and a basic understanding of JavaScript from an Object-Oriented Programming class I took in college.
    </p>
    <p class="project-description">Using Github Pages to deploy my code, I opted not to use any existing Github Portfolio templates to maintain complete creative control. Above all else, I wanted my portfolio to represent me and who I am. It was a big deal to me to say I built this myself! Choosing this route presented a greater challenge as it was completely up to me to determine styling and structure. As a perfectionist, I spent several brain-numbing days trying to bring my vision to life. I hit several roadblocks where I began to question if I bit off more than I could chew, but the breakthroughs, moments of problem-solving, and realization made all my trouble worth it!
    </p>
    <p class="project-description">This site isn’t earth-shattering, but I’m proud of my progress and everything I’ve learned throughout this experience. This project is an embodiment of some of my best traits… I’m a quick learner and a hard worker! This portfolio will never truly be finished as I’ll continue to update it as I progress through my career, but I feel happy enough to share it! Plus, adding a couple of new technical skills to my toolkit is never a bad idea. I’m still a novice in web development, but this is an exciting area where I can see myself continuing to grow!

    </p>
    <p class="project-description">This project examines the product and sales performance of brands/products for BikeStore from 2016-2018. The goal was to determine which products sell, what types of consumers purchase BikeStore products, and why the bicycle brand Trek dominates the space. Findings are featured in an Interactive Tableau dashboard and an accompanying business report. Recommendations and applications to drive business growth are also included at the end of the business report.

      <a href="https://github.com/mjvickers/SQL-Portfolio/tree/bike_store_db" target="_blank">Queries</a>
    </p>
    <p class="project-description">The goal of bike_store_db was to create an efficient relational database from scratch in PostgreSQL. The project has 3 phases: Database Creation, Data Insertion, and Querying Data. Utilizing my expertise in various query statements, I created nine tables, established relations, created user/group roles, and inserted over 1000 records. From there, I generated KPIs focused on product and employee performance to assess the success of the fictitious bike store. Intent on displaying my strength in problem-solving and creativity, I explain my thinking and techniques behind each business scenario.

    </p>
    <p class="project-description">This was a fun project for me! I practiced my skills in multivariate linear regression while working with a data set I was naturally interested in. I'm a huge NBA fan, specifically a Golden State Warriors fan!
    </p>
    <p class="project-description">I asked myself: Was it possible to predict home and away points of any given team based on shooting percentages?
    </p>
    <p class="project-description">I built three regression models to accomplish this. One predicts home points, another predicts away points, and a final model predicts the probability of the home team winning given the current score. The highlight was my probability model, which was over 98% accurate.

    </p>
    <p class="project-description">In 2023, I participated in the Bronco Startup Challenge, where I pitched my idea for Central Talent to a panel of judges.
    </p>
    <p class="project-description">The goal of Central Talent was to help small to large companies maximize sales by offering external aid. We scale our operations and influence based on need. Central Talent would be comprised of a team of external telemarketers with high adaptability. By partnering with clients, we pair our ability on the phone with the gained expertise of products to provide a high-quality sales experience to potential consumers, leads, and clients. Parallel to this, we empower clients to drive their sales pitches by offering training opportunities to build quick rapport with prospects. In my eyes, a successful sales experience is driven by the relationship with the client.
    </p>
    <p class="project-description">I ended up placing 2nd overall in the Bronco Startup Challenge, where I moved on to compete in the 2023 CSU Sunstone Startup Launch Competition at San Jose State University. This experience challenged my understanding of sales while giving me a taste of entrepreneurship.

      <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PS5PSWmmmGvSNN6UH4QgK6LR05eFV2ew/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Schema</a>
    </p>
    <p class="project-description">I want to create a website that directs users to reservation links for campsites in each US National Park. Users will filter down to the campsite that fits their desired trip. Options such as driving accessibility, peak months, size, remoteness, and location will allow users to find the National Park and subsequent campsite that fits them!
    </p>
    <p class="project-description">All the information to reserve a campsite is available, but it’s not centralized, stored consistently, easy to find, or updated in many cases. My website will solve this. Instead of surfing the web and digging through each US National Park website, users can use my “one-stop shop” to find the park that fits their trip and begin planning. This is not a solution just for the hardcore backpackers; it’s a solution for the casual camper looking for a weekend getaway, families, or anyone looking to enjoy the beauty of each National Park!
    </p>
    <p class="project-description">I’ve been passionate about exploring each National Park for as long as I can remember, and I want to share that with everyone!
    </p>
    <p class="project-description">I’ve finished all my data collection and planned my schema for a relational database. I’m currently working on web development. I have all my data, I just need to build the medium to share it with the world!

    <p class="project-description">
      Photography is something I have become very passionate about over the past year! In December 2023, I purchased my first camera, a Canon Sure Shot Tele 80, from a local Camera Store in Chinatown, San Francisco (Camera Zone & Art Gallery - which I would highly recommend checking out!). It was love at first sight! When I became too impatient for film rolls to develop, I caved in… and bought a Sony A6700. Now I never leave home without my Sony.
    </p>
    <p class="project-description">
      I’ve brought my Sony to several camping trips, hikes, air shows, and even across states! I love that I can intertwine my new hobby with my active lifestyle. I love capturing my experiences and sharing them with everyone.

      I’ve included some of my favorites below, but this is not even 1% of my photos. I post slide shows relatively frequently on my TikTok to share my content. If you’re interested in seeing the world through my lens, I implore you to check it out! I’ve linked my TikTok in my contact section and below.
